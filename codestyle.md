# Code Style Guidelines

## HTML

### Document Structure

- Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` for HTML5 documents.
- Organize your HTML code with proper indentation and line breaks for readability.

### Head Section

- Include a descriptive title in the `<title>` element.
- Use external CSS and JavaScript files by specifying the `src` or `href` attributes.
- Group related elements together for a clean and organized `<head>` section.

### Body Section

- Maintain a clear and logical document structure.
- Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility.
- Keep IDs and classes meaningful and descriptive.
- Use CSS styles for styling; avoid inline styles.
- Use JavaScript for interactive functionality.

### Buttons

- Ensure that buttons are clear and descriptive.
- For buttons with JavaScript functions, use `onclick` to call the appropriate function.
- Use `value` attributes for buttons with corresponding values.

### CSS Styles

- Use external CSS files.
- Follow a consistent and well-documented naming convention for classes and IDs.
- Group related styles together.
- Use comments to explain the purpose of certain CSS rules.

## JavaScript

- Use proper indentation and consistent spacing.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).
- Avoid global variables whenever possible. Use local scopes.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Avoid commented-out code in the production version.

## jQuery

- Ensure you've included the jQuery library correctly.
- Maintain a clear structure for your jQuery code.

## AJAX

- Make AJAX requests using appropriate HTTP methods (e.g., POST for data submission).
- Include error handling to handle AJAX request failures.
